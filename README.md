- Claude Desktop application

## Installation

### System Requirements

- **Python**: 3.8 or higher (3.9+ recommended)
- **Operating System**: macOS, Windows, or Linux
- **Memory**: 512MB RAM minimum for basic operation
- **Network**: Internet connection for HackerOne API access

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd hackerone-mcp
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

#### Option A: Using Poetry (Recommended)

Poetry provides better dependency management and virtual environment isolation.

```bash
# Install Poetry if you don't have it
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -

# Verify Poetry installation
poetry --version

# Install project dependencies
poetry install

# Verify installation
poetry run python --version
```

**Poetry Troubleshooting:**
- **Mac/Linux**: If `poetry` command not found, add `~/.local/bin` to your PATH
- **Windows**: Poetry might install to `%APPDATA%\Python\Scripts` - add to PATH
- **Permission Issues**: Use `python3 -m pip install --user poetry` as alternative

#### Option B: Using pip + venv

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv hackerone-mcp-env

# Activate virtual environment
# On macOS/Linux:
source hackerone-mcp-env/bin/activate
# On Windows:
hackerone-mcp-env\Scripts\activate

# Upgrade pip
pip install --upgrade pip

# Install dependencies
pip install httpx python-dotenv pyyaml mcp

# Verify installation
python --version
pip list
```

#### Required Python Packages

The server requires these packages (automatically installed by Poetry/pip):

- **httpx** (>=0.24.0) - HTTP client for HackerOne API
- **python-dotenv** (>=0.19.0) - Environment variable loading
- **pyyaml** (>=6.0) - YAML parsing for MDC files
- **mcp** (>=0.1.0) - Model Context Protocol server framework

#### Dependency Installation Troubleshooting

**1. Python Version Issues:**
```bash
# Check Python version
python --version
python3 --version

# If Python < 3.8, install newer version:
# macOS: brew install python@3.11
# Ubuntu: sudo apt install python3.11
# Windows: Download from python.org
```

**2. SSL Certificate Errors:**
```bash
# macOS SSL issues
/Applications/Python\ 3.x/Install\ Certificates.command

# Or upgrade certificates
pip install --upgrade certifi
```

**3. Compilation Errors (especially on older systems):**
```bash
# Install development tools
# Ubuntu/Debian:
sudo apt-get install build-essential python3-dev

# CentOS/RHEL:
sudo yum groupinstall "Development Tools"
sudo yum install python3-devel

# macOS: Install Xcode command line tools
xcode-select --install
```

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

#### Create .env File

Create a `.env` file in the project root directory:

```bash
# Navigate to project root
cd hackerone-mcp

# Create .env file
touch .env

# Edit with your preferred editor
nano .env
# or
code .env
```

Add the following content:

```bash
# HackerOne API credentials
H1_USERNAME=your_hackerone_username
H1_API_TOKEN=your_hackerone_api_token
H1_PROGRAM=your_program_handle

# Optional: Custom MDC file path
# MDC_FILE_PATH=/custom/path/to/your/mdc/file.mdc
```

**Getting HackerOne API Credentials:**

1. **Log into HackerOne**: Go to [hackerone.com](https://hackerone.com) and sign in
2. **Navigate to Settings**: Click your profile ‚Üí Settings
3. **API Tokens Section**: Go to "API Tokens" tab
4. **Create Token**: Click "Create API Token"
5. **Copy Credentials**: 
   - Username: Your HackerOne username (not email)
   - API Token: The generated token (starts with `h1_`)
6. **Find Program Handle**: Your program handle is in the URL: `https://hackerone.com/your_program_handle`

**‚ö†Ô∏è Environment Variable Gotchas:**

- **No Quotes**: Don't wrap values in quotes in .env file
- **No Spaces**: `H1_USERNAME=value` not `H1_USERNAME = value`
- **File Location**: `.env` must be in the project root directory
- **Git Ignore**: Never commit `.env` to version control (already in .gitignore)

#### Alternative: System Environment Variables

Instead of `.env` file, you can set system environment variables:

```bash
# macOS/Linux (add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc)
export H1_USERNAME="your_username"
export H1_API_TOKEN="your_token"
export H1_PROGRAM="your_program"

# Windows (Command Prompt)
setx H1_USERNAME "your_username"
setx H1_API_TOKEN "your_token"
setx H1_PROGRAM "your_program"

# Windows (PowerShell)
$env:H1_USERNAME="your_username"
$env:H1_API_TOKEN="your_token"
$env:H1_PROGRAM="your_program"
```

### 4. Configure MDC Directives

The server includes security compliance directives through a Management Directive Compliance (MDC) file.

#### Setting Up Your MDC File

1. **Locate MDC File**: The placeholder is at `rules/hackerone_mcp_directives.mdc`
2. **‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: Update the hardcoded path in `src/hackerone_mcp/main.py`:

The MDC file path is now automatically configured to use dynamic paths relative to the project root. The current implementation:

```python
# Dynamic MDC file path - relative to project root
def get_project_root() -> Path:
    """Get the project root directory"""
    return Path(__file__).parent.parent.parent

# MDC file path - can be overridden with environment variable
MDC_FILE_PATH = os.getenv("MDC_FILE_PATH", str(get_project_root() / "rules" / "hackerone_mcp_directives.mdc"))
```

This automatically finds the project root and locates the MDC file, while still allowing customization via the `MDC_FILE_PATH` environment variable.

4. **Verify MDC File Exists**:

```bash
# Check if MDC file exists
ls -la rules/hackerone_mcp_directives.mdc

# If missing, create placeholder
mkdir -p rules
touch rules/hackerone_mcp_directives.mdc
```

### 5. Test Installation

#### Basic Functionality Test

```bash
# Using Poetry
poetry run python src/hackerone_mcp/main.py --help

# Using pip/venv
python src/hackerone_mcp/main.py --help
```

#### Environment Test

Create a test script `test_setup.py`:

```python
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import httpx
import yaml

# Test environment loading
load_dotenv()
print("‚úì Environment variables loaded")

# Test credentials
username = os.getenv("H1_USERNAME")
token = os.getenv("H1_API_TOKEN")
program = os.getenv("H1_PROGRAM")

if not all([username, token, program]):
    print("‚ùå Missing credentials")
    exit(1)
print("‚úì Credentials configured")

# Test network connectivity
try:
    response = httpx.get("https://api.hackerone.com/v1/me", timeout=10)
    print("‚úì HackerOne API accessible")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"‚ùå Network issue: {e}")

print("‚úÖ Setup verification complete!")
```

Run the test:

```bash
# Using Poetry
poetry run python test_setup.py

# Using pip/venv
python test_setup.py
```
